## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v16 or higher
- **Firebase**: For authentication, Firestore, and storage
- **Basic Web Development Tools**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Implementation Process

### 1. Backend Setup
#### Firebase Initialization
1. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
2. Download the service account key and save it as `firebase-service-account.json`.
3. Configure Firebase Admin SDK in `server.js`:

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const serviceAccount = require('./firebase-service-account.json');

admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
    databaseURL: "https://<your-project-id>.firebaseio.com",
    storageBucket: "<your-project-id>.appspot.com"
});
```

#### Express Server
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express socket.io firebase-admin
   ```
2. Set up the server in `server.js`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const { Server } = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server);

app.use(express.static('public'));

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
#### HTML Files
- **`index.html`**: Main chat interface with containers for messages and room management.
- **`signup.html`**: Signup form with Firebase authentication integration.
- **`login.html`**: Login form with Firebase authentication.
- **`profile.html`**: User profile display and editing page.
- **`settings.html`**: Account settings configuration.

# CSS Styling
1. Create `style.css` to provide a unified design for all pages.
2. Use Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.

# JavaScript (Client-Side)
1. Connect to the server using Socket.io:
   ```javascript
   var socket = io();
   ```
2. Handle form submissions and integrate Firebase SDK for user authentication and data storage.

# 3. Real-Time Messaging
1. Implement `join room` and `leave room` functionalities in both the server and client.
2. Store and retrieve chat messages in Firebase Firestore.

### 4. AI-Powered Assistance
1. Use an AI service like OpenAI for chat-based assistance.
2. Integrate the API in `server.js` to respond to user queries dynamically.

# 5. Task Management and Learning Modules
1. Store tasks, reminders, and progress in Firebase Firestore.
2. Create interactive UIs in HTML and use JavaScript to handle user interactions.

# 6. Deployment
1. Deploy the backend using a cloud provider like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.
2. Host the frontend using Firebase Hosting.

# 7. Testing and Debugging
1. Use browser DevTools to debug client-side issues.
2. Test API endpoints with Postman.
3. Monitor server logs for errors and exceptions.
